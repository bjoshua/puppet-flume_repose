# == Class: flume_repose::flume
#
# This class is able to install or remove flume-repose on a node.
#
#
# === Parameters
#
# The default values for the parameters are set in repose::params. Have
# a look at the corresponding <tt>params.pp</tt> manifest file if you need more
# technical information about them.
# 
# [*ensure*]
# String. Controls if the managed resources shall be <tt>present</tt> or
# <tt>absent</tt>. If set to <tt>absent</tt>:
# * The managed software packages are being uninstalled.
# * Any traces of the packages will be purged as good as possible. This may
# include existing configuration files. The exact behavior is provider
# dependent. Q.v.:
# * Puppet type reference: {package, "purgeable"}[http://j.mp/xbxmNP]
# * {Puppet's package provider source code}[http://j.mp/wtVCaL]
# * System modifications (if any) will be reverted as good as possible
# (e.g. removal of created users, services, changed log settings, ...).
# * This is thus destructive and should be used with care.
# Defaults to <tt>present</tt>.
#
# [*enable*]
# Bool/String. Controls if the managed service shall be running(<tt>true</tt>),
# stopped(<tt>false</tt>), or <tt>manual</tt>. This affects the service state
# at both boot and during runtime.  If set to <tt>manual</tt> Puppet will
# ignore the state of the service.
# Defaults to <tt>true</tt>.
#
# The default values for the parameters are set in repose::params. Have
# a look at the corresponding <tt>params.pp</tt> manifest file if you need more
# technical information about them.
#
# [*daemon_home*]
# String. Daemon home path
# Defaults to <tt>/usr/share/lib/repose</tt>
#
# [*log_path*]
# String. Log file directory path
# Defaults to <tt>/var/log/repose</tt>
#
# [*pid_file*]
# String. Pid file location
# Defaults to <tt>/var/run/repose-valve.pid</tt>
#
# [*user*]
# String. User to run the valve as
# Defaults to <tt>repose</tt>
#
# [*daemonize*]
# String. the path to the daemonize binary
# Defaults to <tt>/usr/sbin/daemonize</tt>
#
# [*daemonize_opts*]
# String. The daemonize options to be passed into daemonize.
# DEPRECATED. This does nothing for repose 7+. This is replaced by a different
# variable in the sysconfig file but we are not supporting overwriting it.
# at this time.
# Defaults to <tt>-c $DAEMON_HOME -p $PID_FILE -u $USER -o $LOG_PATH/stdout.log -e $LOG_PATH/stderr.log -l /var/lock/subsys/$NAME</tt>
#
# [*run_opts*]
# String. The options sent to the run command.
# DEPRECATED. This does nothing for repose 7+. This is replaced by a different
# variable in the sysconfig file but we are not supporting overwriting it.
# Defaults to <tt>-p $RUN_PORT -c $CONFIG_DIRECTORY</tt>
#
# === Examples
#
# * Installation:
#
# class { 'repose::valve': }
#
# * Removal/decommissioning:
#
# class { 'repose::valve': ensure => 'absent' }
